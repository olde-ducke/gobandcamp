 # gobandcamp

 Barebones terminal player for bandcamp, uses [Beep](https://github.com/faiface/beep/) package to play actual sound.
 
 For now just waits for user to input valid bandcamp album link, parses info from page, plays full album, then hangs indefinetly.

 Will crash if album has tracks not meant for streaming, and in many other cases.
