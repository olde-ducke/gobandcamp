-- Known problems --
  relatively high CPU load even in idle on both win and linux
  window resizes can lead to spike in CPU load (image resizes with window)
  image will fill all available space if window height ~= width
  seeking can break playback completely, stop/play or track switching fixes that
  url corrupts if it can't fit screen or truncated from right side
  sometimes fails to parse tag search page (buffer is running out of memory again?)
  irregular crashes, cause unknown, seems something is wrong with beep
 linux:
  locks sound playback from other sources
  playback can't initialize if device is being used by something else
  device can not reinitialize after suspend, high CPU load
 win:
  flashing screen, not sure what's the problem
 linux arm:
  https://github.com/faiface/beep/issues/131, same behaviour
