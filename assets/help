-- dependencies --
 same as [oto] https://github.com/hajimehoshi/oto

-- known problems --
  it is possible to trigger download of the same item more than one time
  because of ^ playback can restart when download finishes (needs download manager)
  relatively high CPU load even in idle on both win and linux
  window resizes can lead to spike in CPU load (image resizes with window)
  image will fill all available space if window height ~= width
  seeking can break playback completely, stop/play or track switching fixes that
  url corrupts if it can't fit screen or truncated from right side
  sometimes fails to parse tag search page (buffer is running out of memory again?)
  irregular crashes, cause unknown, (hopefully fixed)
  cursor acts weird sometimes
 linux:
  locks sound playback from other sources
  playback can't initialize if device is being used by something else
  device can not reinitialize after suspend, high CPU load
 win:
  flashing screen, not sure what's the problem
  generally less responsive than on linux
 linux arm:
  https://github.com/faiface/beep/issues/131, same behaviour
